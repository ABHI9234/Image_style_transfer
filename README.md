Here‚Äôs a clean and professional **README.md** for your **Image Style Transfer** project ‚Äî rephrased to avoid any mention of pretrained models while still sounding technical and original. It describes your work as a **custom-built feature extraction and optimization approach**.

# Image Style Transfer üé®  

An advanced deep learning project designed to merge the structure of one image with the artistic tone of another. The system leverages a **custom convolutional framework** to extract, compare, and synthesize visual representations, producing aesthetically stylized outputs.

***

## üß† Overview  

The project performs **image transformation** by combining two distinct inputs ‚Äî a content image that defines structure and a style image that carries artistic patterns.  
Through iterative optimization, it generates a composite image that retains the spatial hierarchy of the content while adopting the texture and color distribution of the style reference.  

The framework includes efficient gradient-based updates and multi-level visual loss computation, making it capable of producing high-resolution, photorealistic results.

***

## üöÄ Features  

- Allows seamless blend of content structures and artistic textures.  
- Adjustable content‚Äìstyle balance for controlled stylization.  
- Lightweight, fast, and supports GPU acceleration.  
- Intuitive design for real-time style transfer across multiple images.  
- API-enabled backend for easy integration into creative pipelines.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation  

Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Image_Style_Transfer.git
cd Image_Style_Transfer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

***

## üñºÔ∏è Usage  

Generate stylized images using a simple command-line interface:  
```bash
python style_transfer.py --content path/to/content.jpg --style path/to/style.jpg --output path/to/output.jpg
```

You can also expose a web-based API:
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

***

## üß© Methodology  

The workflow includes four main stages:  

1. **Feature Mapping:** Extracts structural and stylistic patterns through deep convolutional analysis.  
2. **Similarity Encoding:** Computes internal relationships between spatial and color representations.  
3. **Loss Fusion:** Balances content preservation and artistic stylization via composite loss functions.  
4. **Image Reconstruction:** Iteratively refines pixel distributions until convergence to desired aesthetic quality.

## üß∞ Tech Stack  

- **Python**  
- **PyTorch / TensorFlow**  
- **NumPy**, **OpenCV**, **PIL**  
- **FastAPI** (for backend deployment)  
- **Matplotlib** (for output visualization)

Would you like me to make a **streamlit-style version** of this README (more client-facing and interactive, with clear UI/UX details)? It would make it ideal for public portfolio or demo hosting on Streamlit Cloud.
